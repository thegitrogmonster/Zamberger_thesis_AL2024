            Dating of wood is a major task in historical research, archaeology and paleoclimatology. Currently, the most important dating techniques are dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating. Our approach is based on molecular decay over time under specific preservation conditions. In the models presented here, construction wood, cold soft waterlogged wood and wood from living trees are combined. Under these conditions, molecular decay as a usable clock for dating purposes takes place with comparable speed. Preservation conditions apart from those presented here are not covered by the model and cannot currently be dated with this method. For example, samples preserved in a clay matrix seem not to fit into the model. Other restrictions are discussed in the paper. One model presented covers 7,500 years with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 682 years for a single measurement. Another model reduced to the time period of the last 800 years results in a RMSE of 92 years. As multiple measurements can be performed on a single object, the total error for the whole object will be even lower.},

The presented prediction models cover a maximum of 3000 years and include old living trees, construction wood and cold waterlogged wood. Any other preservation conditions are not covered by these models. Under these conditions, abiotic factors dominate and the contribution of microbial decay is negligible. This is a pre-requisite for the application of the present models. Brittle parts of the wood cannot be dated. Infrared spectroscopy was applied to detect the molecular changes over time. Currently, four models are available for Norway spruce, European larch, oak, and silver fir.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an active learning (AL) algorithm to solve regression problems based on inverse-distance weighting functions for selecting the feature vectors to query. The algorithm has the following features: (i) supports both pool-based and population-based sampling; (ii) is not tailored to a particular class of predictors; (iii) can handle known and unknown constraints on the queryable feature vectors; and (iv) can run either sequentially, or in batch mode, depending on how often the predictor is retrained. The potentials of the method are shown in numerical tests on illustrative synthetic problems and real-world datasets. An implementation of the algorithm, that we call IDEAL (Inverse-Distance based Exploration for Active Learning), is available at http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/bemporad/ideal.},
